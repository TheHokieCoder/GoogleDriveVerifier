# Google Drive Verifier
Google Drive Verifier is a Windows command line utility for verifying files in any Google Drive. When uploading of a file to Google Drive is complete,
Google calculates the MD5 hash of that file, but it is never made available to the account owner through the web interface. This utility pulls that
MD5 hash from the Google Drive API and compares it to the locally calculated MD5 hash. This gives the account owner added assurance that their
critical files uploaded to Google Drive are, in fact, bit for bit, identical copies.
